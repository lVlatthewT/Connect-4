This is a connect 4 game. I had created during an assignment for my university degree. This was created using c#. users can input their names, which personalises the program towards the user
via implementing their names into the main menu section. in addition, users can select how many players are playing a round of connect 4.
This will switch between gamemodes depending on the person which is between PvP and PvE. however, the PvE mode is extremely basic and buggy, so I recommend playing with another person.
each player has their color coded counters, seen in the physical copies of connect 4 which are red and yellow. the user can choose which column to drop their counter into and will drop it at the bottom.

lastly, the program checks for any type of win, which is vertical, horizontal and diagonal and will check for a draw, if the board is full without nay win conditions being met.
